<img src="assets/ARKTIK%20Logo.png" alt="ARKTIK Logo" width="200">


## Vision

Unify ARKTIK’s faith-driven A.C.E. curriculum, MicroFarm deployments, Rust Bridge coding labs, AI-powered subscriptions, and CSA programs into a cohesive, scalable ecosystem that empowers learners, hosts, and communities.

---

## 1. Core Pillars

### 1.1 A.C.E. Curriculum

* **Foundational Tracks**: Orientation (ACE-FND-101), Math & Computational Logic (ACE-MA-R101), Engineering Systems (ACE-ENG-SYS101), Science & Sustainability (ACE-SCI-S101), Communication (LA-PW-101).
* **Advanced Modules**: Professional Development & University Prep (BOA-101), iSTEAM History (HIST-iSTEAM101), Operations & Project Management (OPS-PM101), Kabbalistic Health (BIO-QUANT-101).
* **Delivery**: Self-paced via GitHub repos & Codespaces; peer-reviewed via Teams/Asana; mastery checkpoints with PR-driven submissions.

### 1.2 MicroFarm Deployments

* **10×10 Pilot**: Pay hosts \$50/mo in stored-value; ARKTIK retains 90% yield + AI subscription upsells.
* **Scaling Phases**: Phase 1 (3–5 plots), Phase 2 (10–20 plots + Pro/Enterprise plans), Phase 3 (>50 plots + Blockparty events).
* **CSA Integration**: Pre-season memberships (\$500/season) with seed & crop agreements, risk-sharing, and distribution logistics.

### 1.3 Rust Bridge Coding Labs

* **Workshops**: Rust fundamentals, sensor-control crates, async data processing, AI integration, community governance.
* **Open-Core**: Public crates for basic hardware/software; private repos for premium AI models and subscription logic.
* **Certification**: Badges for PR contributions and workshop completions; hackathons co-hosted at Blockparty events.

### 1.4 AI Subscription Services

* **Basic (\$10/mo)**: Soil & temperature alerts, email support.
* **Pro (\$20/mo)**: pH monitoring, nutrient dosing, SMS alerts, live workshops.
* **Enterprise (\$50/mo)**: Multi-plot management, custom AI tuning, on-site labs, advanced curriculum access.

### 1.5 CSA Program

* **Membership Agreements**: Seed selection, crop-mix %, responsibilities, risk-sharing, pricing, distribution.
* **Legal & Compliance**: 501(c)(3) alignment, UBIT management, private inurement safeguards, board oversight.
* **Member Experience**: Farm pick-up, drop-site hubs, home delivery, surplus donation options.

---

## 2. Delivery Channels & Tools

* **GitHub & Codespaces**: Single-click dev environments with Rust, GraphQL, Node.js, CLI tools preconfigured.
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for Rust crates, front-end tests, codegen, and multi-cloud deployments.
* **Infrastructure**: Dockerized API and dashboard; Helm charts for AKS/GKE; Azure Key Vault & GCP Secret Manager.
* **Collaboration**: Asana for task tracking, Teams for communication, Discord/GitHub Discussions for community.

## 3. Phased Rollout

1. **Pilot (0–3 Months)**: Launch ACE-FND-101 & MicroFarm pilot; basic AI subscriptions; RustBridge kickoff.
2. **Scale (3–6 Months)**: Expand plots, introduce Pro/Enterprise tiers, add advanced A.C.E. modules, host small Blockparty.
3. **Mature (6–12 Months)**: Full CSA enrollment, community Blockparty series, private repo launch for premium offerings, formalize partnerships.

---

## 4. Open-Core & Private Components

* **Public Repo**: A.C.E. courses, open-core microfarm blueprints, Rust crates, AI-stub code, catalog & subscription docs.
* **Private Repo**: AI analytics models, subscription billing engine, premium curricula, infra-as-code, secrets management.

---

## 5. Governance & Compliance

* **501(c)(3) Alignment**: Document educational nexus, separate UBI streams, file Form 990-T if needed, enforce anti-inurement.
* **Security & Privacy**: Credential vaulting, signed binaries, dependency audits, TLS enforcement, log redaction.
* **Legal Review**: CSA agreements, host contracts, privacy policies, intellectual property guidelines.
